# Kubric Docs Content Root

This directory contains the technical documentation content rendered under `/docs/*`.

## Purpose

- Parent/group/implementation pages that map to Kubric module structure
- Source content for DocuNotion 1:1 synchronization
- Sidebar navigation IDs referenced by `sidebars.js`

## Operational Rules

- Treat this directory as canonical content for documentation sync.
- Keep route/tree consistency with `REPO-TREE-MAPPING.md`.
- Website shell (`src/pages`) is code-managed and separate from sync content.
