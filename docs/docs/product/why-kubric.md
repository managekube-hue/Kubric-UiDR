# Why Kubric?

Kubric consolidates fragmented tooling across security, operations, and compliance into one enterprise operating surface. This reduces analyst switching costs, eliminates duplicate controls, and improves remediation velocity.

- Faster mean time to detect and remediate
- Lower tooling overlap and operational complexity
- Better executive visibility across technical and business outcomes
